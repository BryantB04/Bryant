Instructions to Play the Word Search Game
Starting the Game:
Press enter to start the game

Run the script to launch the game window.
Understanding the Interface:

The game window consists of a grid filled with letters.
The list of words you need to find is displayed at the top of the screen.
The current level is also displayed at the top.
Finding Words:

Look for the words listed at the top within the grid.
Words can be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Highlighting Words:

Once you identify a word in the grid, note its position and direction.
Currently, the game does not have an interactive way to highlight words directly through mouse clicks or keyboard input.
Instead, you would manually update the game code to highlight words if you want to track them.
Progressing Through Levels:

To quit the game, close the game window or press the close button on the window.
